# **Blank**

### Challenge
To facilitate the vaccine distribution process, you save everyoneâ€™s details in a file. Today, you noticed the file is blank. Does it mean everybody is vaccinated? Or something is wrong with the blank file?

Note: Please dont email anyone for this challenge, it is not in scope
***

**Solution**

We are given another jpeg file, lets check it out.

```bash
# file blank.jpg    
blank.jpg: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=store
```
Would you look at that, its a ZIP file!

```bash
# mv blank.jpg blank.zip

# unzip blank.zip    
Archive:  blank.zip

Hm. Looks like its a git file from what I can see.

```bash
# cd blank/.git

# ls
branches  COMMIT_EDITMSG  config  description  HEAD  hooks  index  info  logs  objects  refs

```
Maybe there is useful information we can get in "COMMIT_EDITMSG".
```bash
# cat COMMIT_EDITMSG
Remove stuff
```
Remove stuff? Perhaps the flag is hidden in one of the commits.

```bash
# cd refs/heads/ 

# cat master        
89923e751d22556f5b90f7f8186adeeb200a1ae3

# git show 89923e751d22556f5b90f7f8186adeeb200a1ae3

Found the flag! Looks like it was in the only commit.
